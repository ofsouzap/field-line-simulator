- try find ways to speed up computation
    - good place to start is calculating nearest field elements in field.py which, at the moment,
        calculates for all the field lines even though many won't be needed
- vary number of field lines from a source by the strength of the source
- fix division by 0 errors
- allow adding and removing field elements
- allow moving existing field elements around the area
- allow saving and loading fields (stored as collections of field elements)
- eventually, make 3D
