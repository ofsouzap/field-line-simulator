- create charge plane field element (infinite plane of constant charge)
- add grad_at method to field elements, see if this increases performance
- fix division by 0 errors
- add arrowheads to field lines
- check field lines are being generated uniformly around point source. on a single point source can see that it doesn't look correct
- allow moving existing field elements around the area
- allow saving and loading fields (stored as collections of field elements)
- allow displaying areas of high/low divergence and/or curl of the field
- eventually, make 3D
